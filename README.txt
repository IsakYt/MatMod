Here are files for our project in TMA4195.

In the file RHS.py you'll find the functions which generates the grid and system matrices for the model.
In time.py you will find the numerical solver, two plots and an animation already working. Should you wish to study either the receptors or neurotransmitters,
you need only replace rec[i] with nevro[i] within the animate() definition.
